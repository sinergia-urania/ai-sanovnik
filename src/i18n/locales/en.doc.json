    "## Reframing nightmares",
    "- A nightmare often signals high arousal and unresolved emotion.",
    "- Lucidity gives you options: observe, dialogue, transform, or exit safely.",
    "Goal: Respond with curiosity instead of reflexively fleeing or fighting.",
    "## In-dream tools",
    "- Stabilize first: look at palm ‚Üí rub hands ‚Üí slow exhale ‚Üí gentle RC.",
    "- Say: \"I am safe; this is a dream.\"",
    "- Dialogue: ask the figure, \"Who are you? What do you want me to know?\"",
    "- Transform: imagine warm light around you or offer a small gift.",
    "- Ally: call a trusted guide (friend/mentor/animal) to stand with you.",
    "- Boundaries: create a transparent shield or step behind a door and re-enter calmly.",
    "- Scale control: slow time, lower volume, or increase distance by one step.",
    "- Safe exit: if overwhelmed, close eyes <1s, feel the bed, wiggle toes/fingers, breathe, and wake.",
    "Note: You don‚Äôt have to defeat anything; understanding and safety come first.",
    "## Ethics ‚Äî simple rules",
    "- Be kind to dream characters (DCs) ‚Äî whether parts of mind or autonomous, treat them with respect.",
    "- Consent matters: avoid coercion; skip harmful or degrading scenarios.",
    "- Stay aligned with your values; choose low-risk, non-harmful experiments.",
    "- Early on, prefer calm exploration over high-intensity control.",
    "## Aftercare & integration",
    "- On waking, write 3 lines: what happened, how you felt, what helped.",
    "- Grounding: drink water, stretch, look out a window for natural light.",
    "- If frequent, distressing nightmares impact sleep or daytime life, consider consulting a qualified professional.",
    "Exercise: Write a \"nightmare plan\": two calming sentences (e.g., \"I am safe\" + \"I can ask questions\") and one safe action (call an ally, open a door to light, or step back while breathing)."

  "tonight": "Prepare your nightmare plan on a small note by the bed. Set the intention to respond with curiosity. If a nightmare arises, stabilize, speak your calming sentence, try dialogue or summon an ally; if overwhelmed, exit safely and journal in the morning."
